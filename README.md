# Google Data Analytics Case Study - Final Project

My Case Study in R language for Google Data Analytics Certification.

Here I have used the R language to specify the metrics for bicycles which were rented and used from time periods ranging from 2019 to 2021. The project uses the R language to import the dataset and perform manipulations in order to get a better overview of the data.

The results thus obtained are for the viewers to capitalize on the prospect of obtaining bikes for single time share or at an yearly purchase, and for casual v/s active riders.
